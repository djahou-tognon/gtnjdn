I am currently pursuing a PhD in Applied Mathematics at the [Institut National de Recherche en Sciences et Technologies du Numérique (INRIA) Centre de Paris](https://inria.fr/fr), as part of the [ANGE Project-Team](https://team.inria.fr/ange/) in collaboration with [Sorbonne Université](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/) within the [Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions (LJLL)](https://www.ljll.fr/). 

<!--My research focuses on __High-Performance Computing (HPC)__, with a particular emphasis on the development of __parallel-in-time algorithms (PinT)__ and the analysis of their convergence behavior for solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) constrained optimization problems. In addition to my work in HPC, I am exploring the intersection of scientific computing and machine learning, known as __Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)__. My aim is to leverage SciML techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of solving complex PDEs, contributing to advances in both computational mathematics and machine learning.

I am passionate about developing computational methods that push the boundaries of performance and scalability, with the broader goal of solving challenging real-world problems through mathematical modeling and simulation.-->

I am also interested in domain decomposition methods in general and computational fluid dynamics.
